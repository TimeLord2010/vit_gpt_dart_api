# Endpoint detection

Learn how speech endpoint detection works.

## Overview

{/\*
Endpoint detection lets you know when a speaker has finished speaking.
This is critical for real-time voice AI assistants, command-and-response
systems, and conversational apps where you want to respond **immediately** without
waiting for long silences.

When enabled, Soniox automatically detects natural pauses and emits a special `<end>` token at the end of an utterance.

Endpoint detection lets you know when a speaker has finished speaking. This is
critical for real-time voice AI assistants, command-and-response systems, and
conversational apps where you want to respond immediately without waiting for
long silences.

Unlike traditional endpoint detection based on voice activity detection (VAD),
Soniox provides semantic endpointing where the speech model listens to intonations, pauses, and
conversational context to determine when an utterance has ended. This makes it
far more advanced — delivering **lower latency, fewer false triggers,** and a
noticeably **smoother product experience.**

## How it works

When `enable_endpoint_detection` is **enabled**:

- Soniox monitors pauses in speech to determine the end of an utterance.
- As soon as speech ends:
    - **All preceding tokens** are marked as final.
    - A special `<end>` **token** is returned.
- The `<end>` token:
    - Always appears **once** at the end of the segment.
    - Is **always final**.
    - Can be treated as a reliable signal to trigger downstream logic (e.g., calling an LLM or executing a command).

## Enabling endpoint detection

Add the flag in your real-time request:

```json
{
    "enable_endpoint_detection": true
}
```

## Example

<h3>User says</h3>

```text
What's the weather in San Francisco?
```

<h3>Soniox stream</h3>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Non-final tokens (still being processed)**

    First response arrives:

    ```json
    {"text": "What's",    "is_final": false}
    {"text": "the",       "is_final": false}
    {"text": "weather",   "is_final": false}
    ```

    Second response arrives:

    ```json
    {"text": "What's",    "is_final": false}
    {"text": "the",       "is_final": false}
    {"text": "weather",   "is_final": false}
    {"text": "in",        "is_final": false}
    {"text": "San",       "is_final": false}
    {"text": "Francisco", "is_final": false}
    {"text": "?",         "is_final": false}
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Final tokens (endpoint detected, tokens are finalized)**

    ```json
    {"text": "What's",    "is_final": true}
    {"text": "the",       "is_final": true}
    {"text": "weather",   "is_final": true}
    {"text": "in",        "is_final": true}
    {"text": "San",       "is_final": true}
    {"text": "Francisco", "is_final": true}
    {"text": "?",         "is_final": true}
    {"text": "<end>",     "is_final": true}
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

1. **Streaming phase:** tokens are delivered in real-time as the user
   speaks. They are marked `is_final: false`, meaning the transcript is still being
   processed and may change.
2. **Endpoint detection:** once the speaker stops, the model recognizes the end of the utterance.
3. **Finalization phase:** previously non-final tokens are re-emitted with `is_final: true`, followed by the `<end>` token (also final).
4. **Usage tip:** display non-final tokens immediately for live captions, but switch to final tokens once `<end>` arrives before triggering any downstream actions.

## Controlling endpoint delay

In addition to semantic endpoint detection, you can also control the maximum delay between
the end of speech and returned endpoint using `max_endpoint_delay_ms`.
Lower values cause the endpoint to be returned sooner.

Allowed values for maximum delay are between 500ms and 3000ms.
The default value is 2000ms.

Example configuration:

```json
{
    "max_endpoint_delay_ms": 500
}
```
